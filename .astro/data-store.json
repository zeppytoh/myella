While Tailwind provides an extensive set of built-in styles, it’s also easy to customize your project with your own fonts and styles. In this blog post, we’ll go through the steps to apply custom fonts and styles on a Tailwind CSS project using the tailwind.config.js file.\n\n## Choose Your Fonts\n\nThe first step to applying custom fonts on a Tailwind CSS project is to choose the fonts you want to use. There are many websites where you can download free fonts or use a CDN such as: You can also use paid fonts from websites like:\n\n- [Font Share](https://www.fontshare.com/)\n- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\n- [Colletivo](https://www.collletttivo.it/)\n- [Type Cooper](http://coopertype.org/)\n- [The league of movable type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/)\n- [Velvetyne](https://velvetyne.fr/)\n  or paid fonts from:\n- [Linotype](https://www.linotype.com)\n- [Atypo](https://www.atipofoundry.com/)\n- [Pangram Pangram](https://pangrampangram.com/)\n- [Typeheist](https://typeheist.co/) Once you have chosen your fonts, you need to add them to your project. You can do this by downloading the font files and placing them in a folder within your project’s directory.\n\n## Define Custom Font Family\n\nAfter downloading the font files or using the CDN, you need to define a custom font family in the tailwind.config.js file. Open the file and add the following code to the theme section.first-letter: Here is an example of Lexington Themes talwind.config.js file\n/\\*_ @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} _/\nconst defaultTheme = require(\"tailwindcss/defaultTheme\");\nmodule.exports = {\ntheme: {\nfontFamily: {\nsans: [\"Inter var\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\nmono: [\"JetBrains Mono\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n},\n},\n};\nIn this code, “Inter var” and “JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font family you want to use, “Inter var” and “JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font you downloaded or used the CDN, and `defaultTheme.fontFamily` is the fallback font in case the custom font doesn’t load.\n\n## Define Custom Styles\n\nOnce you have defined the custom font family, you can define custom styles that use it. You can create a class for each style or add them to existing Tailwind CSS classes. For example, you can add custom styles to the h1 class as follows:\nmodule.exports = {\ntheme: {\nfontSize: {\nxs: [\n\"0.75rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1rem\",\n},\n],\nsm: [\n\"0.875rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1.5rem\",\n},\n],\nbase: [\n\"1rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1.75rem\",\n},\n],\nlg: [\n\"1.125rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"2rem\",\n},\n],\nxl: [\n\"1.25rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"2rem\",\n},\n],\n\"2xl\": [\n\"1.5rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"2rem\",\n},\n],\n\"3xl\": [\n\"2rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"2.5rem\",\n},\n],\n\"4xl\": [\n\"2.5rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"3.5rem\",\n},\n],\n\"5xl\": [\n\"3rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"3.5rem\",\n},\n],\n\"6xl\": [\n\"3.75rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1\",\n},\n],\n\"7xl\": [\n\"4.5rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1.1\",\n},\n],\n\"8xl\": [\n\"6rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1\",\n},\n],\n\"9xl\": [\n\"8rem\",\n{\nlineHeight: \"1\",\n},\n],\n},\nextend: {\nfontFamily: {\nsans: [\"Inter var\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\nmono: [\"JetBrains Mono\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n},\n},\n},\n};\nIn this code, we added custom styles to outsite the theme section to be able ot override Tailwind’s classes. We added a custom font weight and line-height.\n\n## Apply Custom Styles\n\nTo apply your custom styles to your HTML, use the class attribute and the classes you created or extended in the tailwind.config.js file. For example, to apply the custom styles to an h1 element, add the class attribute as follows:\n\u003Ch1 class=\"font-sans\">Hello World\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp class=\"font-mono\">Hello World, again\u003C/p>\nIn this code, you do not need to add the `font-sans` class because is the default class that Tailwind css uses, but you will have to use `font-mono` to define the mono font within your HTMl. But no inside `\u003Cpre>` or `\u003Ccode>` because the font is already mono\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, customizing fonts and styles in a Tailwind CSS project using the tailwind.config.js file is straightforward. You can choose your fonts, define a custom font family, define custom styles, and apply them to your HTML elements using the classes you created or extended. With these steps, you can create unique and personalized designs that stand out from the rest.","src/content/posts/4.md","84a0aab714fb0d77",{"html":703,"metadata":704},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This blog post shows how to add custom typography to your Tailwind CSS project, with example code.\u003C/em>\nTailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-defined classes to make web development faster and more efficient.

Open the file and add the following code to the theme section.first-letter: Here is an example of Lexington Themes talwind.config.js file\n/*_ @type {import(‘tailwindcss’).Config} _/\nconst defaultTheme = require(“tailwindcss/defaultTheme”);\nmodule.exports = {\ntheme: {\nfontFamily: {\nsans: [“Inter var”, …defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\nmono: [“JetBrains Mono”, …defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n},\n},\n};\nIn this code, “Inter var” and “JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font family you want to use, “Inter var” and “JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font you downloaded or used the CDN, and \u003Ccode>defaultTheme.fontFamily\u003C/code> is the fallback font in case the custom font doesn’t load.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"define-custom-styles\">Define Custom Styles\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Once you have defined the custom font family, you can define custom styles that use it. You can create a class for each style or add them to existing Tailwind CSS classes. For example, you can add custom styles to the h1 class as follows:\nmodule.exports = {\ntheme: {\nfontSize: {\nxs: [\n“0.75rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1rem”,\n},\n],\nsm: [\n“0.875rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1.5rem”,\n},\n],\nbase: [\n“1rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1.75rem”,\n},\n],\nlg: [\n“1.125rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “2rem”,\n},\n],\nxl: [\n“1.25rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “2rem”,\n},\n],\n“2xl”: [\n“1.5rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “2rem”,\n},\n],\n“3xl”: [\n“2rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “2.5rem”,\n},\n],\n“4xl”: [\n“2.5rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “3.5rem”,\n},\n],\n“5xl”: [\n“3rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “3.5rem”,\n},\n],\n“6xl”: [\n“3.75rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1”,\n},\n],\n“7xl”: [\n“4.5rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1.1”,\n},\n],\n“8xl”: [\n“6rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1”,\n},\n],\n“9xl”: [\n“8rem”,\n{\nlineHeight: “1”,\n},\n],\n},\nextend: {\nfontFamily: {\nsans: [“Inter var”, …defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\nmono: [“JetBrains Mono”, …defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n},\n},\n},\n};\nIn this code, we added custom styles to outsite the theme section to be able ot override Tailwind’s classes. We added a custom font weight and line-height.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"apply-custom-styles\">Apply Custom Styles\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To apply your custom styles to your HTML, use the class attribute and the classes you created or extended in the tailwind.config.js file. For example, to apply the custom styles to an h1 element, add the class attribute as follows:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 class=\"font-sans\">Hello World\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp class=\"font-mono\">Hello World, again\u003C/p>\nIn this code, you do not need to add the `font-sans` class because is the default class that Tailwind css uses, but you will have to use `font-mono` to define the mono font within your HTMl. But no inside `\u003Cpre>` or `\u003Ccode>` because the font is already mono\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In conclusion, customizing fonts and styles in a Tailwind CSS project using the tailwind.config.js file is straightforward. You can choose your fonts, define a custom font family, define custom styles, and apply them to your HTML elements using the classes you created or extended. With these steps, you can create unique and personalized designs that stand out from the rest.\u003C/p>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>",{"headings":705,"imagePaths":721,"frontmatter":722},[706,709,712,715,718],{"depth":75,"slug":707,"text":708},"choose-your-fonts","Choose Your Fonts",{"depth":75,"slug":710,"text":711},"define-custom-font-family","Define Custom Font Family",{"depth":75,"slug":713,"text":714},"define-custom-styles","Define Custom Styles",{"depth":75,"slug":716,"text":717},"apply-custom-styles","Apply Custom Styles",{"depth":75,"slug":719,"text":720},"conclusion","Conclusion",[],{"pubDate":723,"author":694,"title":691,"description":693,"image":724,"tags":725},["Date","2023-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"],{"url":696,"alt":394},[644,698],{"id":150,"data":727,"body":736,"filePath":737,"digest":738,"rendered":739,"legacyId":199},{"title":728,"pubDate":729,"description":730,"author":731,"image":732,"tags":734},"The Time Traveler's Notebook",["Date","2023-07-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"A mysterious notebook falls into the hands of a young woman, leading her on a journey through time as she learns about the lives of those who came before her.","Giovanni Russo",{"url":733,"alt":394},"/images/thumbnail3.svg",[619,735],"Tailwind","## Hello Everyone\r\n\r\n....– Hey Michael! we don't need more tutorials on how to build a theme, there's 100s!\r\nYou may say...\r\nI,...simply wanted to do my version because I have been building my own theme and is easier than you may think.\r\n\r\n- [My theme, Serendipity](https://serendipitytheme.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Let's get our hands dirty.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can customize the theme you are actually using by opening the **User settings** on VS Code your **command palette**\r\nOnce you are there you can edit the .json by starting with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\r\n    ---- Styles go here ----\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see all the scopes here:\r\n\r\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color\r\n  But, this is a nightmare to be honest, as you can see there's a lot of scopes and it will take you ages to do it.\r\n\r\n## Let's create our own theme from scratch\r\n\r\nWe are going to need:\r\n\r\n- A laptop\r\n- VS Code installed\r\n- Microsoft Azure Account\r\n- Microsoft Marketplace Account\r\n- GitHub Account\r\n- Patience\r\n  We are going to use:\r\n- VS Code\r\n- Terminal\r\n- VS Code Debugger\r\n- A random but useful color tool\r\n  For color palettes you use my tool [Colors & Fonts](https://www.colorsandfonts.com/)\r\n  or for something more advance, use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)\r\n\r\n## First and foremost\r\n\r\nLet's grab the command line tool called [Yo Code extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), which it will create all the files you need to build your theme.\r\nOnly build, not publish but more on this later on.\r\n\r\n1.
