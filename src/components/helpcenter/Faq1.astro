    question: "Is my wallet data safe?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We never store private keys, and all wallet interactions happen client-side. Your funds stay in your control — always.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support multiple chains?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We’re multi-chain by design, with support for Ethereum, Solana, Base, and more. Swap, stake, and track across ecosystems seamlessly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for more than one wallet?",
    answer:
      "Yep. Add as many wallets as you want. Cold, hot, hardware — we support them all. Even that one you forgot about in 2021.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I lose access to my wallet?",
    answer:
      "We don’t custody funds, so recovery depends on your setup. We highly recommend using hardware wallets, backups, and secure seed storage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you collect or sell my data?",
    answer:
      "Never. Your data stays on your device or encrypted. No tracking, no creepy analytics, no selling to sketchy ad networks. Period.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track DeFi positions and NFTs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We support real-time DeFi position tracking, yield farming dashboards, and NFT overviews — all in one clean interface.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this only for advanced crypto users?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. Whether you’re new to Web3 or managing DAO treasuries, our tools scale with your skill level — no PhD in crypto required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my data or switch platforms?",
    answer:
      "Of course. Your data is yours. Export everything anytime, no questions asked. We're open-source friendly and vendor-lock-in allergic.",
  },
