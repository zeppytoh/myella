2. Navigate to **Settings > Security**.
3. Select **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
4. Choose your preferred method (SMS, email, or authenticator app).
5. Follow the setup instructions and confirm your changes.

### Identifying Fraudulent Activities
Stay vigilant by recognizing common fraud indicators:
- Unexpected login alerts from unknown devices.
- Unfamiliar transactions or withdrawals.
- Emails requesting sensitive information from unverified sources.
- Suspicious phone calls claiming to be from customer support.

If you notice any of these, **immediately report it** via our [Support Page](#_).

### Preventing Phishing Attacks
Phishing scams attempt to steal your personal information through fake emails, messages, or websites. To avoid them:
- Never share passwords or PINs via email.
- Verify email senders before clicking on links.
- Always access your account through the official website, not email links.
- Use an updated web browser and enable security alerts.

### Reporting Fraud

1. Contact our **Fraud Prevention Team** immediately.
2. Change your password and enable extra security settings.
3. Review your transaction history for unauthorized activity.
