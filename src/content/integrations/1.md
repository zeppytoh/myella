# How to Integrate PayPal with Your App

Integrating PayPal into your app can enhance your payment processing capabilities and offer a secure and convenient payment option for your users. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Visit the PayPal Developer Site

Navigate to the [PayPal Developer Site](https://developer.paypal.com/) and sign in with your PayPal account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

## Step 2: Create a New App

Once logged in, go to the **Dashboard** section and select **My Apps & Credentials**. Here, you can create a new app by clicking on the **Create App** button.

## Step 3: Obtain Your API Keys

After creating your app, you will be directed to a page with your app details, including your **Client ID** and **Secret**. These are your API keys that will be used to authenticate your integration.

## Step 4: Integrate with Your App

Use the obtained API keys in your application to set up the PayPal SDK. PayPal provides SDKs for different programming languages and platforms, making it easier to integrate:

- For server-side implementations, select the SDK that matches your backend technology.
- For client-side integrations, such as web or mobile apps, use the PayPal JavaScript SDK or mobile SDKs accordingly.

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

PayPal offers a sandbox environment for you to test your integration without making real payments. Ensure to test all payment flows and scenarios to verify that everything works as expected.

## Getting Help

Should you encounter any issues or have questions during the integration process, you can reach out to PayPal support at `integrations@paypal.com` or consult the [PayPal Developer Documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/) for comprehensive guides and API references.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate PayPal into your app, offering a secure and versatile payment solution to your users.
